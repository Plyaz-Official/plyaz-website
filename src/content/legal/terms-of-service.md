## 1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms

Welcome to **PLYAZ Ltd** (‚Äú**PLYAZ**‚Äù, ‚Äú**we**‚Äù, ‚Äú**our**‚Äù, or ‚Äú**us**‚Äù)

These Terms of Service (‚Äú**Terms**‚Äù) govern your access to and use of the **PLYAZ website, mobile application, and all related services** (collectively, the ‚Äú**Platform**‚Äù).

By accessing or using the Platform, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our **Privacy Policy**, which forms part of this agreement. If you do not agree, you must not access or use the Platform.

At this stage, the Platform operates as a **community and networking environment only**. Users may create verified profiles and engage with other members of the football community. No payment processing, campaign funding, or financial transaction functionality is currently active.

PLYAZ provides a secure and transparent digital platform designed to connect verified football stakeholders ‚Äî including released players, agents, clubs, fans, and governing bodies ‚Äî within an ethical and compliant ecosystem.‚Ä®PLYAZ acts solely as a **technology facilitator**, not an intermediary, employment agency, or representation service.

- **‚ÄúPlayer Profile‚Äù** means a verified online profile created by a player containing personal and football-related information, achievements, and updates.
